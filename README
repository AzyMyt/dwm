I have no idea what I am doing.
most patches are just implemented by me directly, I may replace things in the future

If I end up using a block of code from chatgpt I will leave its very obvious chatgpt comments so it is clear when I have used it.
I do not want it to write the thing for me but if I dont understand something, ask it, and it spits out something that makes sense to me, I'm going to implement it, this is significantly more convenient than reading 40 pages of C documentation.

Features in this fork:
Proper fullscreening
Gaps spacing applied to the bar
Media key binds (using playerctl and pactl)
Focus master
Alpha patch (bar transparency, fixed border opacity)

Issues:
Certain windows marked as floating may not properly spawn in the middle of certain monitors

TODO:
apply resize corners patch
apply systray patch
implement cursor warp functionality
columns layout or something
outside-window borders maybe
